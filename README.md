## Installation

This software can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

## Examples

We provide several examples of the main functionalities of ```emodel-generaliastion``` software:
* run MCMC on a simple single compartment model
* run MCMC on a simple multi-compartment model
* run the entire generalisation worklow on a simplified version of the L5PC model of the publication <cite>[Arnaudon et al. (2023)][1]</cite>
* provide all the scripts necessary to reproduce the figures of <cite>[Arnaudon et al. (2023)][1]</cite>. For the scripts to run, one has to donwload the associated dataset on dataverse  with the script ```get_data.sh```


## Citation

When you use the ``emodel-generalisation`` software or method for your research, we ask you to cite <cite>[Arnaudon et al. (2023)][1]</cite> associated to this repository (use the `Cite this repository` button on the [main page](https://github.com/BlueBrain/emodel-genealisation) of the code).
